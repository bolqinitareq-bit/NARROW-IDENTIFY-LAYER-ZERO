# **Narrow Identity Layer Zero — Vision**

This directory contains the **vision documents** that define the long‑term direction, purpose, and philosophical foundation of Narrow Identity Layer Zero.  
These documents explain *why* Narrow exists, *what problems it solves*, and *how it aims to reshape identity and trust across decentralized and intelligent systems.

The vision is not a technical specification.  
It is the guiding narrative that informs every design decision in the protocol.

## **Included Documents**

### **1. vision-statement.md**  
A high‑level articulation of Narrow’s mission:  
to provide a universal, chain‑agnostic identity substrate for humans, devices, agents, and applications.

It outlines:

- the identity fragmentation problem  
- the need for a neutral Layer Zero  
- the role of schemas, attestations, and resolution  
- the future of trust in multi‑chain and AI‑driven ecosystems

## **Purpose of the Vision Folder**

The documents here serve to:

- align contributors and developers around a shared direction  
- communicate the long‑term strategy to partners and investors  
- provide philosophical grounding for the technical specs  
- ensure Narrow evolves consistently and transparently  
- define the “why” behind the protocol’s architecture  

While the specs define **how Narrow works**,  
the vision defines **why Narrow matters**.

## **Audience**

The vision documents are intended for:

- protocol architects  
- developers and contributors  
- researchers  
- investors  
- ecosystem partners  
- anyone evaluating Narrow’s long‑term potential  

They provide context before diving into the technical specifications.

---

## **Status**

The vision documents evolve more slowly than the technical specs.  
They represent the stable, long‑term direction of Narrow and are updated only when the mission or strategic scope expands.
