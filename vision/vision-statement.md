# **Narrow — Vision Statement**

## **A Universal Identity Layer for a Trustless World**

Narrow exists to solve one of the oldest and most persistent problems in digital systems:  
**identity without ownership, trust without centralization, and interoperability without fragmentation.**

As the world moves toward decentralized networks, autonomous agents, and intelligent systems, identity becomes the foundation that everything else depends on.  
Yet today, identity is scattered across platforms, chains, devices, and applications — each with its own rules, formats, and trust assumptions.

Narrow’s vision is to unify this landscape by providing a **neutral, chain‑agnostic Identity Layer Zero** that any system can build on.

## **What Narrow Enables**

### **1. A Single Identity Root for Every Entity**  
Humans, devices, agents, and applications can all anchor their identity to a deterministic, portable root that works everywhere.

### **2. A Universal Schema System**  
Structured, versioned schemas define how identity, reputation, access, and trust are expressed across ecosystems.

### **3. A Global Attestation Fabric**  
Attestations become the language of trust — verifiable, composable, and independent of any chain or platform.

### **4. Seamless Integration Across Systems**  
From blockchains to backend services to AI agents, Narrow provides a unified interface for identity resolution and verification.

### **5. A Token‑less, Neutral Standard**  
No token, no fees, no lock‑in.  
Narrow is a protocol, not a product.

## **Why This Matters**

The next decade will be defined by:

- autonomous agents making decisions  
- devices interacting without human oversight  
- multi‑chain applications  
- cross‑platform identity requirements  
- AI systems that need trust signals  
- decentralized governance and access models  

All of this requires a **shared identity foundation** — one that is:

- secure  
- portable  
- verifiable  
- interoperable  
- future‑proof  

Narrow is built to be that foundation.

## **Long‑Term Vision**

Narrow aims to become:

- **the global identity substrate** for decentralized and intelligent systems  
- **the standard** for identity roots, schemas, and attestations  
- **the trust layer** that agents, devices, and applications rely on  
- **the bridge** between Web2, Web3, and AI ecosystems  

A world where identity is not owned by platforms, but by the entities themselves.

A world where trust is not assumed, but verifiable.

A world where interoperability is the default, not the exception.

## **The Future We’re Building**

Narrow is not just a protocol — it’s a shift in how identity works.  
A move from fragmented silos to a unified layer.  
From platform‑owned identity to self‑anchored identity.  
From isolated trust models to a global attestation fabric.

This is the foundation for the next generation of decentralized and intelligent systems.

And this is the future Narrow is designed to power.
