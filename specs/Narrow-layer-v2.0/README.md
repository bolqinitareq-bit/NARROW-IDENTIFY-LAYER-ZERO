# **Narrow Identity Layer Zero — v0.2 Specifications**

This directory contains the core technical specifications for **Narrow Identity Layer Zero v0.2**.  
These documents define the foundational components of the protocol, including identity roots, schemas, attestations, resolution logic, and integration models.

The v0.2 specification represents the first unified version of Narrow as a **Layer Zero identity substrate**, replacing the earlier v0.1 identity‑engine model.

---

## **Included Specifications**

### **1. identity-root.md**  
Defines the deterministic, chain‑agnostic identity root model used for humans, devices, agents, and applications.

### **2. schema-system.md**  
Describes the schema architecture, versioning model, validation rules, and schema registry.

### **3. attestation-framework.md**  
Specifies how attestations are issued, structured, verified, and resolved across systems.

### **4. resolution-layer.md**  
Explains how identity roots are resolved into schemas, attestations, metadata, and external mappings.

### **5. integration-layer.md**  
Defines how external systems (chains, apps, agents, devices) integrate with Narrow.
