# Narrow — Pitch Narrative

Narrow exists to solve one of the oldest problems in digital systems:  
how to establish identity and trust without centralization or fragmentation.

As AI agents, devices, and decentralized systems grow, the world needs a neutral identity substrate.  
Narrow provides that substrate through identity roots, schemas, attestations, and a resolution layer.

This narrative explains the strategic positioning, market timing, and long‑term potential of Narrow.
