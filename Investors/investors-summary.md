# Narrow — Investor Summary

## The Problem
Identity today is fragmented across platforms, chains, devices, and applications.  
No universal, neutral identity layer exists for decentralized or intelligent systems.

## The Solution
Narrow provides a chain‑agnostic, token‑less Identity Layer Zero built on:
- deterministic identity roots  
- structured schemas  
- verifiable attestations  
- a unified resolution layer  

## Why Now
AI agents, multi‑chain systems, and autonomous devices all require a shared trust substrate.

## Opportunity
Narrow becomes the identity backbone for:
- AI ecosystems  
- decentralized networks  
- cross‑chain applications  
- device authentication  
- agent‑to‑agent trust  

## Long‑Term Vision
A universal identity layer powering the next generation of intelligent and decentralized systems.
