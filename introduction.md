# **Introduction to Narrow Identity Layer Zero**

Narrow is a universal, chain‑agnostic identity substrate designed for humans, devices, agents, and applications.  
It provides a neutral foundation for trust in a world where systems are distributed, intelligent, and increasingly autonomous.

Modern digital ecosystems suffer from fragmented identity models, incompatible trust systems, and isolated verification methods.  
Narrow solves this by introducing a unified identity layer built on four core pillars:

### **1. Deterministic Identity Roots**  
Every entity—human, device, agent, or application—anchors to a portable, collision‑resistant identity root that works across chains and platforms.

### **2. Structured Schemas**  
Identity, reputation, access control, and device/agent models are expressed through versioned schemas that ensure consistency and interoperability.

### **3. Verifiable Attestations**  
Trust is represented through attestations: signed, structured statements that describe facts, behaviors, capabilities, or reputation signals.

### **4. A Unified Resolution Layer**  
Any system can resolve an identity root into its associated schemas, attestations, and metadata using a single, chain‑agnostic interface.

## **Why Narrow Matters**

As AI agents, autonomous devices, and multi‑chain applications grow, the world needs a shared identity foundation.  
Narrow provides:

- a neutral trust layer  
- a portable identity model  
- a unified way to express and verify information  
- a substrate that works across ecosystems, not inside one silo  

Narrow is not a blockchain, not a token, and not a centralized service.  
It is a minimal, deterministic protocol designed to be the identity backbone of decentralized and intelligent systems.
