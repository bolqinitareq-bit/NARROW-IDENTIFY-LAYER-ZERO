# **NARROW — IDENTITY LAYER ZERO**

Narrow is a universal, chain‑agnostic **Identity Layer Zero** designed to provide a trusted foundation for humans, devices, and agents across decentralized and traditional systems.  
It is not a blockchain, not a token, and not a wallet — it is the **identity substrate** that everything else can build on.

Narrow enables applications, protocols, and AI systems to verify identity, reputation, and trust without friction, fees, or platform lock‑in.

---

## **Why Narrow Exists**
Identity today is fragmented across Web2, Web3, and AI ecosystems.  
Every platform creates its own identity silo, forcing users and developers to rebuild trust from scratch.

Narrow solves this by providing:

- A **single identity root** for any entity  
- A **schema‑driven model** for structured identity data  
- A **unified attestation framework**  
- A **neutral, token‑less trust layer**  
- A **Layer Zero foundation** that any chain or system can integrate with  

Narrow is built to be the missing identity fabric for the next generation of decentralized and intelligent systems.

## **Core Features**
- **Identity Root Engine**  
  Deterministic, portable identity roots for humans, devices, and agents.

- **Schema Registry**  
  Structured, versioned schemas for identity, reputation, access, and more.

- **Attestation Framework**  
  Verifiable, composable attestations with optional ZK‑compatibility.

- **Resolution Layer**  
  Maps identities to schemas, attestations, and external systems.

- **Chain‑Agnostic Integration**  
  Works across EVM chains, L2s, off‑chain systems, and AI agents.

- **Token‑less Architecture**  
  No token required for verification or participation.
